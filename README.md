# 20 days Data Science Challenge 2021  

Enthusiastic about Data, I have decided to challenge myself in learning Data Science concepts for 20 days and share my learning journey in this repository. You will find here all the exercices, homeworks and projects completed each day. As well as the complete selfmade program I have followed during those 20 days. Note that this program is based on my personal interests and skills. I welcome feedbacks so feel free to comment or share your own journey with me. This challenge started in April 2021 and be completed after posting all the 20 days. So without futher ado: **Let's Dive Deep into Data Science!**
